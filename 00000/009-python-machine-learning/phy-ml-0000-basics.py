'''
Artificial Intelligence (AI): A broad field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that 
usually require human intelligence, such as reasoning and decision-making.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

Neural Networks: A type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and process complex information.

Deep Learning: An advanced branch of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to extract high-level features from large volumes of data.

Generative AI: A specialized area of AI that generates new content—such as text, images, audio, or code—based on patterns learned from existing data.

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

We can split the data types into three main categories:

Numerical data: numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
    Discrete Data - counted data that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
    Continuous Data - measured data that can be any number. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item

Categorical data: Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

Ordinal data: Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
