'''
Encapsulation is about protecting data inside a class.
It means keeping data (properties) and methods together in a class, while controlling how the data can be accessed from outside the class.
This prevents accidental changes to your data and hides the internal details of how your class works.

Encapsulation provides several benefits:
Data Protection: Prevents accidental modification of data
Validation: You can validate data before setting it
Flexibility: Internal implementation can change without affecting external code
Control: You have full control over how data is accessed and modified
