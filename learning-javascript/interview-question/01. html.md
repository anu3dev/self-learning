### HTML

- Symentic tags - those tags which clearly described its meansing to browsers as well as users. like: header, footer, nav, section, main etc.
  non symentic tags are like div, span which tells nothing about its content.

- canvas in html used in designing some figures, it only gives a blank space on which we can design things using javascript.

- Element => An element is a single ‘chunk’ of code comprising of an opening and closing tag.

```
<code><div>This is a div element</div></code>
```

- Tags => Tags are the bits that make up elements. <div> is a tag. An opening and closing tag makes an element.

- Attribute => An attribute is a piece of code attached to a tag which supplies additional information like alt.

- html5 tags => article, aside, audio, canvas, footer, header, nav, section, video etc.

### CSS

- All CSS Pseudo Elements e.g. ::after, ::before, ::first-letter, ::first-line, ::marker, ::selection
- All CSS Pseudo Classes e.g. :active, :checked, :disabled, :empty, :enabled, :first-child, :first-of-type

- Benifits of SCSS

1. we can declare variables

```
$blue: #004BB4;

Once you have created the variables, you can use them wherever you need to, like this:

h1 {
  color: $blue;
}
```

2. uses nested syntax

```
.navbar {
  font: $ubuntu-font;
  color: $blue;
  li {
    margin-left: 1rem;
    a {
      padding: 5px;
      font-size: 1.5rem;
      span {
        font-weight: 600;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. we can customized bootstrap

```
$grid-breakpoints: (
  xs: 0,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 992px,
  xl: 1200px,
  xxl: 1440px
) !default;
```

4. we can use import / include.

### Data attribute

```
<div data="large">Hello</div>
<div kp="ao">Hello</div>

[data="large"] {
  color: red;
}
[kp="ao"] {
  font-size: 20px;
  color: blue;
}
```

5. There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

Pseudo-classes
Links can be displayed in different ways:
:link, :visited, :hover, :active

Pseudo-element
::first-line, ::first-letter

6. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:

flex container properties are:

flex-direction
flex-wrap
flex-flow
justify-content
align-items
align-content

flex item properties are:

order
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
flex
align-self

7. Data attribute

- HTML

```
<div data="large">Hello</div>
<div kp="ao">Hello</div>
```

- CSS

```
[data="large"] {
  color: red;
}
[kp="ao"] {
  font-size: 20px;
  color: blue;
}
```

### HTML5

> html is case-insensetive language but best practice is to write in small letter.
> syntax has been changed

```
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "stylefile.css">
<script src = "scriptfile.js"></script>
```

> some newly introduced tags are => section, article, aside, header, footer, nav, dialog, figure.
