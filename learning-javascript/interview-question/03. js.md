### getElement By Id

<p id="demo" style="display:none">Hello JavaScript!</p>
<button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='block'">Click Me!</button>

### Display data

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML. i.e. document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert(). i.e. alert(5 + 6); bcos window is a global scope object ad bydefault window is belog to this object.
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

### identifier

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

### undefined and refrence error

value is declared but doesnot assigned a value then undefined
value is neither decalred nor assigned the refrence error

### let & const

let and const provies bloack scope, before ES6 there were two scopes, function and global scope

{
var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here

{
let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here

var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 2

var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{
let x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10

Variables defined with const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared.

Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run.

# js execution

in js, every thing happens inside execution context, in execution context, two things will happen, memory allocation and code execution.
in memory allocation,
for variable- memory declaration is done for variable and assign a undefined value.
this is the reason that in const we get syntax error bcos we cant assign value again to const so in const declaration and value assign should be done at the same time.
for function, just copies the everything.

in code exectuion,
varable will be assigned a value.
and ignores the fxn and remain as it is until it finds a fxn invocation statement, then it again again creates an execution context and repeat the same thing.

in case of looping, js manages the execution context by call stack, in call stack it basically store the order in which execution context should be called.

### hoisting

we can access varaible and fxn even before defining it is called hoisting.

### scope

where u can access a variable is called scope

### laxical scope

laxical means a order, it is created with execution context so we can say child fxn is sitting laxicaly inside parent and parent fxn is sitting axically inside the global

### temporal dead zone

value of let and const creates a block scope means we cant access it outside the block scope.
in hoisting, variables are moved to the top and until it is initilized some value, between this gap is called the temporal ded zone.
to avoid the temoral dead zone, alwz try to initilize value at the top means in global scope.

### block

{} is called block, when we write more than one statement, to combile aa the statement we write {}.

### closure

to acces value from one's scope, parents scope and global scope is called closure.

### fxn declaration and expression

fxn declaration is like a normal fxn
fxn expression is like a variable
difference between both is hoisting. if we call fxn expression it will give error bcos it acts as a variable and in memory alocation phase, value will be undefined.

### anonymous fxn

fxn without name, as per ECMA script a fxn must have name, it is used where we want to use it as a value

### first class fxn

we can pass a fxn to a fxn using argument.

### data types

number, string, bigint, boolean, undefined, null, object, function, symbol

### js object

Objects can also have methods.

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

Note: class is blueprint of object.

### promises

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
handled with then and catch
While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.

When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.

When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.

### deounce

has two parameter, fxn and timer, so the mentioned time, js engile stops this fxn from firing.

### memoize

Memoization is a programming technique for caching the results of previous expensive computations so that they can be quickly retrieved without repeated effort when the same inputs are passed

### curry

Currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments, into sequence of functions with single argument.In other words, when a function, instead of taking all arguments at one time, takes the first one and return a new function that takes the second one and returns a new function which takes the third

### symbol

unique identifier, even we create it with same description.
let assume there is a user object and it belog to some other module and we need to perform some action with this object so in this case if we add some values like id then it might be the chance it will conflict with existing code so we will create a id with symbol and will perform our action.
but sometimes, we want even these symbols to be equal so we use global symbol.
const a = symbol("id") = symbol
const a = symbol.for("id") = global symbol
there is a gloal symbol registry as well, means when we create the global symbol, js engine first try to find out in its repo if found then its ok else create a new one.

### DOM

Document Object Model
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

### shalow and deep copy

```
let person = {name: "anurag"}
let person1 = person;

console.log(person.name); // anurag
console.log(person1.name); // anurag bcos object is of refrence type like person1 is copy of address of person object.

person1.name = "nitish";

console.log(person.name); // nitish
console.log(person1.name); // nitish
```

```
let person2 = Object.asign({}, person);
person2.name = "nitish";

console.log(person.name); // anurag
console.log(person2.name); // nitish
```

```
let person2 = {...person};   // using speard operator
person2.name = "nitish";

console.log(person.name); // anurag
console.log(person2.name); // nitish
```

### event bubbling and event capturing

event bubbling : event is handled by element then its outer element.
event capturing : event is handled by outer then its inner element.

### Closure

```
function init() {
  let name = 'Mozilla';
  function displayName() {
    console.log(name);      // Mozilla
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```

### Hoisting

- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top, a variable can be used before it has been declared.

```
let x;
console.log(x);     // undefined
x = 10;
console.log(x);     // 10
```

- Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized, in let: undefined but in const : syntax error

### Temporal Dead Zone

- The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared.

### Scope

- Before ES2015, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope. Let and Const keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript.
- function scope

```
// code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use carName
}

// code here can NOT use carName
```

Variables declared with var and let are quite similar when declared inside a function.

```
var a = 10;
function ab() {
  console.log(a);   // undefined
  var a = 20;
  console.log(a);   // 20
}
ab();
```

- Block scope
  <br>
  Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have Block Scope.

```
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
```

```
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
```

### immutable

- Mutable is a type of variable that can be changed. In JavaScript, only objects function and arrays are mutable, not primitive values.
- There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.

```
var bar = 'baz';
console.log(bar);
bar.toUpperCase();
console.log(bar);
```

### Copy array

- copy array by value

```
const sheeps = ['🐑', '🐑', '🐑'];

// Old way
const cloneSheeps = sheeps.slice();

// ES6 way
const cloneSheepsES6 = [...sheeps];
```

- copy array by refrence

```
const sheeps = ['🐑', '🐑'];

const sheeps2 = sheeps;
```

- Comparision

```
const sheeps = ['🐑', '🐑', '🐑'];

const fakeSheeps = sheeps;
const cloneSheeps = [...sheeps];

console.log(sheeps === fakeSheeps);
// true --> it's pointing to the same memory space

console.log(sheeps === cloneSheeps);
// false --> it's pointing to a new memory space
```

- issue with copying array

```
var a = [1, 2, 3];
var b = a;
b[0] = 10;
console.log(a);     // [ 10, 2, 3 ]
console.log(b);     // [ 10, 2, 3 ]
```

### Deep copy and shalow copy

- you do not really have to worry about copying primitive data types in JavaScript. When you make a copy, it will be a real copy.

```
let a = 5;
console.log(a);
let b = a;
console.log(b);
b = 10;
console.log(b);
console.log(a);
```

- Technically, arrays are also objects, so they behave in the same way.
- A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable. A shallow copy means that certain values are still connected to the original variable.
- shalow copy

```
const a = {
  en: 'Hello',
  pt: 'Olà'
}
let b = a
console.log(b)
console.log(a)
```

- deep copy

```
const a = {
  foods: {
    dinner: 'Pasta'
  }
}
let b = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a))
console.log(b)
console.log(a)
```

- can copy from object.assign and speard operator

```
const a = {
  en: 'Bye',
  de: 'Tschüss'
}
let b = {...a}
console.log(b)
console.log(a)
```

- N0te You can also use it to merge two objects together, for example const c = {...a, ...b}.
- Object.assign

```

const a = {
  en: 'Bye',
  de: 'Tschüss'
}
let b = Object.assign({}, a)
console.log(b)
console.log(a)
```

- copy a array can be using map, filter, reduce, rest operator, slice

```
const a = [1, 2, 3];
let b = [...a];
console.log(b);
```

```
const a = [1, 2, 3];
let b = a.map((el) => el);
console.log(b);
```

```
const a = [1, 2, 3];
let b = a.slice();
console.log(b);
```

### filter unique value array

```
let matchingStr = ['Anurag', 'Amjad', 'Sangita', 'rtyu', 'Anurag'];
console.log([...new Set(matchingStr)]);
```

### object

```
let obj = { ccc: 1, aaa: 3, bbb: 2 };
console.log(Object.values(obj)); // [ 1, 3, 2 ]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));  // [ 'ccc', 'aaa', 'bbb' ]
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)); // [ 'ccc', 'aaa', 'bbb' ]
```

### Symbol

```
let id = Symbol('name');
let id1 = Symbol('name');

console.log(id === id1);
```

### Debounce

> Debouncing is a practice used to improve browser performance. There might be some functionality in a web page which requires time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript is a single threaded language. Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.

```
let debouncedFn = debounce(() => console.log("hello"), 5000);
debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();
debouncedFn();
debouncedFn(); // Will run after ~5s and print "hello" only once
```

```
function debounce(callFn, delayTime) {
  let debounceTime;
  return (...args) => {
    if (debounceTime) {
      clearTimeout(debounceTime);
    }
    debounceTime = setTimeout(() => {
      callFn.apply(this, args);
    }, delayTime);
  };
}
```

### function declaration & function expression

- function declaration

```
function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

> Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

```
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

- Function Expressions

```
var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};
var z = x(4, 3);
```

> The function above is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name).
> Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.
> Arrow functions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used.

### js hoisting

> In a web page, global variables belong to the window object.
> Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top that is why a variable can be used before it has been declared.
> Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
> Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
> Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
> Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run.
> The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:

### JS Object

> In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object</br>
> Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)</br>
> Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)</br>
> Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)</br>
> Dates are always objects</br>
> Maths are always objects</br>
> Regular expressions are always objects</br>
> Arrays are always objects</br>
> Functions are always objects</br>
> Objects are always objects</br>
> All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects</br>
