<summary> 🟩 Box Model + z-index stacking. </summary>

Every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box, consisting of four layers:

```sql
|--------------------------------|
|        Margin (outer)          |
|  ----------------------------  |
|  |      Border layer        |  |
|  |  ----------------------  |  |
|  |  |   Padding area    |  |  |
|  |  |  ---------------  |  |  |
|  |  |  | Content |     |  |  |
|  |  |  ---------------  |  |  |
|  |  ----------------------  |  |
|  ----------------------------  |
|--------------------------------|
```

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* recommended */
}
```

The z-index determines which element appears “on top” when elements overlap.
However, it only works within the same stacking context.

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1; /* creates stacking context */
}
.child {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 999; /* only relative within .parent, not global */
}

```

<summary> 🟩 position relative/absolute/fixed/sticky </summary>

```css
/* position relative */
.element {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;  /* Moves the element 10px down from its original position */
}

/* position absolute */
.container {
  position: relative;  /* Needed to position the child absolutely within it */
}

.element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;    /* 20px from the top of its nearest positioned ancestor */
  left: 30px;   /* 30px from the left */
}

/* fixed absolute */
.element {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;    /* Stick to the top of the viewport */
  left: 0;   /* Stick to the left */
}

/* sticky absolute */
.element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;  /* Sticks to the top when scrolling */
}
```

<summary> 🟩 Specificity rules </summary>

- Four values:
    - A (Inline styles) — highest priority.
    - B (ID selectors) — second priority.
    - C (Class selectors, pseudo-classes) — third priority.
    - D (Element selectors, pseudo-elements) — lowest priority.

<summary> 🟩 Reflow vs Repaint </summary>

- Reflow (Layout Thrashing)
    - Definition: Reflow (also known as layout recalculation) occurs when the browser needs to recalculate the layout of elements after a change that affects their position, size, or geometry (such as adding/removing elements, changing dimensions, or modifying the content).

    - What triggers reflow?
        - Changing element dimensions (e.g., width, height).
        - Modifying the position of elements.
        - Adding/removing elements in the DOM.
        - Changing font sizes or the content inside an element.
        - Changing the display, visibility, or float properties.

- Repaint (Style Changes)
    - Definition: Repaint happens when you change the visual appearance of an element without affecting its layout (position or size). Repaint only affects the visual styles such as color, background, borders, etc.

    - What triggers repaint?
        - Changing visual styles that don’t affect the element's size or layout (e.g., color, background-color, border, visibility, etc.).
        - Changing the visibility of an element (show/hide).
        - Changing the opacity.

<summary> 🟩 Flexbox vs Grid </summary>

- Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout)
- Use case: Best for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column).
- How it works:
    - Flexbox is designed for linear, one-dimensional layouts, where you want to align items horizontally or vertically.
    - The container is a flex container, and the items inside become flex items that can be distributed along a row or column.

- Pros:
    - Simple and ideal for small-scale layouts like navigation bars or centering content.
    - Provides powerful alignment and distribution options using justify-content, align-items, align-self.
    - Great for responsiveness (e.g., dynamic width/height adjustments).
    - Works well when elements need to grow or shrink based on available space.

    ```css
    .container {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute space evenly between items */
    }

    .item {
        flex: 1; /* Items take up equal space */
    }
    ```
