### backend-design

- Gang of Four
    - Creational — control object creation
        - Singleton — ensure one instance + global access.
        - Factory Method — subclass decides which class to instantiate.
        - Abstract Factory — family of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
        - Builder — step-by-step construction of complex object (good for many optional params).
        - Prototype — clone existing objects.
    - Structural — compose classes/objects into larger structures
        - Adapter — make incompatible interfaces work together.
        - Decorator — add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
        - Facade — provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
        - Composite — tree structures of objects treated uniformly (leaf + composite).
        - Proxy — placeholder controlling access to another object.
    - Behavioral — object interaction and responsibilities
        - Strategy — swap algorithms at runtime.
        - Observer — publish/subscribe; observers update on subject changes.
        - Command — encapsulate requests as objects (undo/redo, queues).
        - Iterator — sequential access to elements without exposing internals.
        - Template Method — skeleton of algorithm in base class with steps overridden by subclasses.
        - State — object behavior changes with its internal state.
