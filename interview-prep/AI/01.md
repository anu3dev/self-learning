# 🧠 Evolution of Generative AI (in simple terms)

Generative AI is a part of **Deep Learning**,  
which is a part of **Machine Learning**,  
which itself is a part of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

## 🤖 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of AI that can **create new things**, such as:

- ✍️ Writing text (like essays or emails)  
- 🎨 Making images (like art or photos)  
- 🎵 Creating music, and more  

It works by learning from a large amount of data and then generating something **new** that looks or sounds similar to what it learned.

## 🌟 Examples

Some famous Generative AI tools:

- **GPT-3** – writes text like a human  
- **DALL·E** – creates images from text  
- **MusicLM** – composes music  

These tools are trained on huge datasets and can make content that’s smart, relevant, and human-like.

## 🧩 How It Works (in simple steps)

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** – teaches machines to think and solve problems  
- **Machine Learning** – helps machines learn from data and make decisions  
- **Deep Learning** – uses big, layered neural networks to solve harder problems like recognizing images or understanding language  
- **Generative AI** – takes deep learning further by **creating brand-new content** instead of just recognizing patterns
